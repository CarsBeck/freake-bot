A personal project using Rust to create a Discord bot, by using Serenity, Poise, and Shuttle to host it.

## Roadmap

- Voting/polling
- Scheduling
- Custom useful links?

## Environment Variables

To run a similar project, you will need to add a Secrets.toml file that contains your "discord token".

For example my Secrets.toml file resembles:

```toml
  DISCORD_TOKEN = "Insert your token here!!!"
```
